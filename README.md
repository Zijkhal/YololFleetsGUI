# Yolol Fleets GUI

This is a simple GUI for the [Saturn's Envy](https://github.com/martindevans/Yolol-SpaceShipCombatSimulator) game created by [Yolathothep](https://github.com/martindevans). It provides a GUI to select the fleets that battle against each other, as well as options to save the generated replay, and open the [Replay Player](https://github.com/martindevans/Yolol-SpaceCombatPlayer) to view the battle.

## How to use

At first launch go to the settings, and select the folder where the [Combat Simulator](https://github.com/martindevans/Yolol-SpaceShipCombatSimulator) and the [Replay Player](https://github.com/martindevans/Yolol-SpaceCombatPlayer) are located.

Next at the main window you can specify two fleets to battle each other, to do this, select the fleet's "Root Folder" as described in [Combat Simulator](https://github.com/martindevans/Yolol-SpaceShipCombatSimulator/blob/master/readme.md#Folder-Structure). When both fleets are selected, press the "Simulate!" button to run the battle.
After the battle has finished, you can save the replay file, and / or copy the path to the temporary file to view it in the [Replay Player](https://github.com/martindevans/Yolol-SpaceCombatPlayer).
